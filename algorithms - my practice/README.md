External logics with source

Source of challenges:
______________

**First:**

    count_word_repeat.py

    count_numbers_in_a_string.py

    word_counter_in_a_string.py

    unrepeated_words.py

    The video used C# instructions. I did it with pure logic -> imperative language

___________

**Two:**

    a_single_for_integers_added_together_give__target.py

__________

**Three:**

    queue_logic.py

From the data structure course. I improved the logic, added new methods and made a small console user interface to manipulate the logic

_______

**Four:**

    greedy_algorithm_ATM.py

Reinforce logic by adding dynamic coin repository. In the class it was done on a static repository.

Dictionary manipulation, lists, list ordering.
